# Final Report: Rally Racer Game #

**Game Description:**

A driving game, designed for those who are visually impaired, where players can use a connected feedback wheel and pedals to control a car. 
Players receive audio directions from a co-pilot during gameplay. Players will turn the wheel as instructed in order to get a higher score. 
If a direction is not followed, the player will crash and have the option to restart.


**Intended Audience:**

The Rally Racer Game is an audio simulator designed primarily for those with visual impairments.


**How to Build and Deploy:**

The Rally Racer game requires input from a usb force feedback wheel and pedals. 

**Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries Used:**

The Rally Racing Game was created using a usb force feedback wheel, input from connected pedals, and the Unity game engine to read the input from the acessories and simulate gameplay. The game scripts were coded using C#.
The Unity game engine was also how we handled the audio in the game.


**Problems Encountered and Future Work:**

Future additions to the Rally Racing Game would be to add more visual features to the driving game, so that those who are hearing impaired can enjoy driving around too. Another feature to add would be different levels of gameplay for varying levels of difficulty.
