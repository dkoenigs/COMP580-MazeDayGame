#Rally Racer Game#

**Game Description:**

A driving game, designed for those who are visually impaired, where players can use a connected feedback wheel and pedals to control a car. 
Players receive audio directions from a co-pilot during gameplay. Players will turn the wheel as instructed in order to get a higher score. 
If a direction is not followed, the player will crash and have the option to restart.

**Technologies, Frameworks, and Libraries Used:**

The Rally Racing Game was created using a usb force feedback wheel, Unity, and the Unity game engine to read the input from the feedback wheel. 
The Unity game engine was also how we handled the audio in the game.



**Team Members:** Coleman Manchester, Daniel Koenigsperger, and Erica Wirth
